## Intent
Obviously this is a work in progress but as of Nov. 27th I am working on identifying the best cross platform method of supporting a broad range of devices. 

I am looking towards Artoo for inspiration as I think it is easy to work with and straight forward.

If you have a device you would like to see supported please submit a issue.
